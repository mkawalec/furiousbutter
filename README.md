=============

A client-side blogging engine that intends to be as small as possible while allowing for all the features one expects from a blog software (posts, categories, comments). Different theme and rendering engines support is built in, as is caching of all textual requests.

### Why only render on the client side?

Honestly? I am unsure why it would be beneficial to have a client side only blogging engine. I hope that in the course of developement an unusual feature will reveal itself (webRTC will probably be of a lot of help here) and it will make much more sense to have this client in pure JS.

Think of it as a research project for now.

### Who is it for?

At the current stage, purely for JS and CoffeeScript hackers. But after it is able to display stuff, it should be much more inclusive.
